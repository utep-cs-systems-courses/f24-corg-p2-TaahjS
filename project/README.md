Welcome to Simon Says!

The game will begin by displaying a pattern to the user which will come in the form of 5 lights.
You will know the pattern is finished when you hear buzzing. However, you can only enter input
AFTER the buzzing is finished (though you may try to no avail). 

To copy the pattern, you must use the switch on the MSP430 to switch between red and green. If
you press down, it is green. If you do nothing to the switch, it is red. You will be given
exactly one second to select a color. If you succeed at that specific time, you progress
to the next pattern (which is marked by 2 lights brightly lit). If you fail, the game ends (which
is marked by 2 dimly lit lights).
